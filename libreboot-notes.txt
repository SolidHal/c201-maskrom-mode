SolidHal> swiftgeek I tried out all of the RK3288_Loader images including the ones that included "uboot" in the file name. All seemed to do the same thing, or at least provided the same serial output. I tried loading up the sdboot_rk3288.img as well, guessing what memory address to use from the firefly documentation but didn't get anything to work. 
22:05 <SolidHal> TL;DR I can get maskrom mode to dump out some information but don't have any way to move forward and actually run anything. Notes can be found here https://github.com/SolidHal/c201-maskrom-mode
22:48 <SolidHal> swiftgeek anyway I'm not going to go too much deeper down the maskrom rabbit hole. Without additional documentation it will be hard to get anything functional. Instead I'm going to work towards a full libreboor (coreboot+depthcharge) image we can flash onto the rom from software. This will be much much less fragile than the current method of libreboot support on the c201, hopefully leading to less bricked c201s
22:48 <SolidHal> The current libreboot for the c201 just haphazardly replaces the depthcharge in the image, which means if the c201 is running a different coreboot version than expected things will break. This is Bad.
22:49 <SolidHal> *libreboot not libreboor lol

23:31 <swiftgeek> SolidHal: it's not a rabbit hole lol
23:33 <swiftgeek> SolidHal: the issue I have is that you seem to run tests in some remote offline location so instead figuring out it feels more like programming voyager probe
23:34 <swiftgeek> SolidHal: did you do what manual said and loaded RK3288_Loader image from rockchip and used rkdevelop with it as documented?
23:35 <swiftgeek> db is first step, next one should be like 
23:35 <swiftgeek> rd
23:35 <swiftgeek> (unless mask rom provides that then something else)
23:37 <swiftgeek> maybe trid / trfi / trci
23:38 <swiftgeek> there is no rabbit hole, docs are plentiful, the only missing link is example that would list/have every file used 
23:40 <swiftgeek> at this point in time libreboot on c201pa is less documented that anything related to rkdevelop :D
23:52 <swiftgeek> at least log points to all uboot sources for device
23:53 <swiftgeek>  board/rockchip/common/mediaboot/sdhciBoot.c
00:09 <swiftgeek> lol that was part of \t 
00:09 <swiftgeek> no wonder i can't find it
00:10 <swiftgeek> https://gist.github.com/tf0054/71ea17165fd67b13dd89bbcdb348b908
00:10 <swiftgeek> this is random log i just found
00:13 <swiftgeek> sadly no result on booting a thing through it 
00:14 <swiftgeek> oh it was added much later lol
00:22 <swiftgeek> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nolange/rk3288-guide/master/bootloader.md this one documents sdboot
01:02 <swiftgeek> this one even documents parts of maskrom path https://gitlab.denx.de/u-boot/custodians/u-boot-rockchip/blob/HEAD/doc/README.rockchip
01:18 <swiftgeek> ah so * maybe rid / rfi / rci
