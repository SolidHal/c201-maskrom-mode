17:02 <SolidHal> whoops, got myself kicked
17:02 <swiftgeek> Is that RKXXLoader.bin equivalent of qcom's firehose/MPRGxxxx? 
17:03 <swiftgeek> yes don't paste into backlog :D
17:03 <swiftgeek> unless it's a few lines

17:04 <SolidHal> Not sure, I'm not familiar with qcoms anything
17:04 <swiftgeek> well qcom is just like rk3288 on flowchart
17:04 <swiftgeek> loads whatever over usb and executes it
17:05 <swiftgeek> well loads elf
17:05 <swiftgeek> and optionally does signature checking :)
17:05 <swiftgeek> but if you want anything done you need to write that code 
17:06 <swiftgeek> and it makes sense to provide only that because you don't want to have any bugs in mask rom
17:06 <swiftgeek> coz you ain't fixing that in the field

17:07 <swiftgeek> > RK3288Loader_uboot_Apr182014_155036.bin
17:08 <swiftgeek> that looks like something you could build yourself?
17:08 <swiftgeek> also > sdboot_rk3288.img
17:08 <swiftgeek> maybe boot mini linux and reflash from ther exD
